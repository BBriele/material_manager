# Welcome to My Node.js & Express Webserver Project! 🎉

## 🚀 What’s This All About?

Hey there! This is my first foray into web development! 🚀 I built this Node.js webserver with Express to manage materials and equipment from my old job where I was the assistant manager. It’s not perfect—think of it as a prototype from the 90s. It works, but it’s got some rough edges. 🕰️

## 📦 How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repo**: First, grab this gem of a project. Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install all the necessary packages:
  ```bash
    cd your-repo
    npm install
  ```

3. **Run the Server**: Start the server with:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  Your server will be live at http://localhost:3000 🎉

## 🛠️ What’s Under the Hood?
**Node.js**: The backbone of this project. 💪
**Express**: The framework that makes routing and handling requests a breeze. 🌪️

## ⚠️ What to Know
**Not Perfect**: This is my first real web project, so don’t expect it to follow every best practice. It’s like that VHS collection you’ve still got in your attic—charming but a bit outdated. 📼
**Improvements**: There’s plenty of room for growth. If you’ve got suggestions or want to contribute, I’m all ears! 🐰
